Welcome to my page! I am a recent graduate from Durham University Where I obtained a BA(Hons) in Sport, Exercise and Physical Activity. As a new sports graduate, I feel there is still a lot to learn and I am looking for a new challenge and to progress within the sports, media, marketing and creative arts.

I am a very dedicated and enthusiastic worker, who takes pride in anything I do. I have over several years of experience in the coaching and instructor industry. During my time with Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club (RHKYC), Sport 100, and previous coaching organisations, I have developed a range of skills which include dealing directly with customers, making sure that everything is done to the correct standard, managing people on site as well as being able to adapt to any situation put in front of me.


**Interests**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
